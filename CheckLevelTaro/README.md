# CheckLevelTaro

This project has been done to parse data from the web about the level of the local river TarÃ² in Meda-MB-Italy, and trigger an alarm when it get to a critical threshold, possibly resulting in floods.
Main application is the activation during the night to wake up in case of emergencies (phone needs to be connected to the internet).
